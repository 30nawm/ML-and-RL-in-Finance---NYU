# 🤖 Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning in Finance (NYU)

This repository contains my personal learning notebooks, exercises, and project submissions from the “Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning in Finance” specialization offered by New York University (NYU) on Coursera.

The specialization dives deep into how machine learning (ML) and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques can be applied to modern financial problems. Throughout the course, I explored how these advanced computational methods help build smarter trading systems, optimize portfolios, and model complex market dynamics.

Each notebook represents a key milestone in my learning journey, connecting theory, mathematics, and practical implementation using Python and real financial data.

### 🎯 Learning Objectives & Acquired Skills

During this specialization, I learned to:

Apply supervised and unsupervised learning to financial time series and risk modeling.

Build reinforcement learning models for portfolio optimization and dynamic hedging.

Understand and implement Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), and Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) in financial contexts.

Model market dynamics using stochastic processes, Black–Scholes equations, and Markov Decision Processes (MDP).

Develop a structured workflow for data-driven trading strategies and pricing derivatives under uncertainty.

By completing the course, I gained a practical understanding of how AI can be integrated into financial

### 🧠 Notes

These notebooks are based on the assignments and practical projects from the NYU specialization on Coursera.

All work reflects my personal implementations, understanding, and experimentation with the course material.

Each notebook combines mathematical theory, financial modeling, and Python-based simulation to explore the intersection of AI and quantitative finance.
